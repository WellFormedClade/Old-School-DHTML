# Old-School-DHTML
In the late 90s I worked for a failing startup and had time on my hands. I'd been a webmaster prior to that job - not a particularly good one, but at that time just about anyone could get a job developing web sites - so I decided to take on a project. There was a CNET article with code for DHTML drag-and-drop, and I ran with it to create a dress-up site featuring my (then) young nephew. Think Victorian paper dolls with outfits that fold onto the main character. 

I decided to post these files here for the people out there who think that a '64 Impala - even in the worst of shape - is something cool. An fascinating time capsule of sorts, just like this DHTML (not to mention the ASCII art I threw in).
